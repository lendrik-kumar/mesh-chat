phase 1 - the post office exists 
my job is to run forever and react to events
Daemon lifecycle , even queue , one brain loop 
phase 2 - mail has a shape
know we will start packets and all bytes become a mail
phase 3 - i dont deliver twice 
no duplication bitch
phase 4- where to go 
phase 5 - i can wait

store and forward 
phase 6 - trucks exist 
move the fucking thing 
phase 7 get the mails 
phase 8 lock the fucker
